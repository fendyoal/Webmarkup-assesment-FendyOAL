					<h3> Solar panels </h3>
				</header>
                <p>
                    Solar panels or Photovoltaic modules use light energy (photons) from the Sun to generate electricity through the photovoltaic effect.
                    Most modules use wafer-based crystalline silicon cells or thin-film cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The structural (load carrying) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. 
                    Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. Module electrical connections are made in series to
                    achieve a desired output voltage or in parallel to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals.
                    Bypass diodes may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.

					<h3> Charge controllers </h3>
				</header>
                <p>
                    A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array. It ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day
                    and that the power doesn’t run backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some charge controllers are available with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is its primary job. A solar charge controller is available in two different technologies, PWM and MPPT.

					<h3> Battery system </h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    To appreciate why you might choose to install a solar-plus-storage system for your home, you first need to understand how a standard home solar PV system functions.
                    The typical solar energy system includes solar panels, an inverter, equipment to mount the panels on your roof,
                    and a performance monitoring system that tracks electricity production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solar panels collect energy from the sun and turn it into electricity, which is passed through the inverter and converted into a form that you can use to power your home.

					<h3> DC power </h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Direct current (DC) electricity is what solar panels produce and what batteries hold in storage,
                    while alternating current (AC) electricity is the type used on the grid and in most household devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A device called an inverter is required to convert the DC electricity from solar panels into appliance-friendly AC. A DC-connected energy storage system connects to the grid
                    mains at the same place as the solar panels; this usually means that they share a ‘hybrid’ inverter. 
                </p>

					<h3> Inverter </h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of the solar inverter is to translate or “invert” the solar energy generated by your solar panels from DC to AC so that your home and utility grid can use it.
                    So that’s the first and most crucial service it provides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, in addition to inverting energy from one form to another, your inverter serves another important purpose: online communication. Solar inverters allow you
                    to connect your solar energy system to the internet, which in turn allows you to access information about your system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is especially helpful when you want to compare your solar energy production against your household energy consumption.

					<h3> AC power </h3>
                </header>
                <p>                    
                    All solar panels generate DC (direct current) power. An AC solar panel is the combination of a solar panel with a pre-installed DC to AC inverter. These inverters are referred to as micro-inverters.
                    They come either pre-installed on a solar panel or are attached to the solar panel on the job site during installation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because each AC panel is equipped with its own micro-inverter, the disadvantage of voltage drop affecting entire solar array, as it does in centralized inverter systems, is eliminated.
